This is a timer made with HTML, CSS, and JS. This project is to practice classes and calling DOM elements from within the class. 

Also I am using this to practice seperation of concerns. Making sure to serperate the code so that it focuses on a single 'thing'. Until now, I made code work but I want to improve the way the code is written. 

Lastly, something other small things to refresh on. Like getters and setters, the 'this' in classes and arrow functions, and the countdown border.
